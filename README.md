### Why me? 🤷🏽‍♀️

🔹Although my path in the IT world began only a year ago, in me, you will find a person who found a new passion in this area, which leads me to spend hours in front of the computer discovering and learning new technologies and eager to give everything of myself to create unique products 🙌🏽

### Two important aspects that make me who I am today:

🔹I am argentine 🇦🇷, and like most people in Latin America, this means that I am used to changing and unstable scenarios, which leads us to reinvent ourselves and seek creative solutions to day-to-day problems.
